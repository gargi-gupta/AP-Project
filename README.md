-->Design analysis of the project (Brief description of our FMS system and it’s use cases):

1. Due to obvious reasons, we have considered that GM/admin already exist because without
them the system can’t exist. So to initiate the system, admin needs to be present at the least.

2. In the diagram we have taken admin(already existing), supervisor and staff. And rest is the
system having various use cases(i.e. the specific functionalities). And they can balog to any of
the 5 departments.

3. At the very first step, user is asked to enter his choice(as to which department he belong/will
belong to.
