    22. Logout
    23. Leave by supervisor

-->Design analysis of the project (Brief description of our FMS system and it’s use cases):

1. Due to obvious reasons, we have considered that GM/admin already exist because without
them the system can’t exist. So to initiate the system, admin needs to be present at the least.

2. In the diagram we have taken admin(already existing), supervisor and staff. And rest is the
system having various use cases(i.e. the specific functionalities). And they can balog to any of
the 5 departments.

3. At the very first step, user is asked to enter his choice(as to which department he belong/will
belong to.

4. Then as per the department he chooses, he is again prompted to enter another choice for sign
up/login.

5. Sign-up: In this case, admin puts a check whether he allows the user to be added to the
system or not. If yes, he is be added to the respective database(based on the department), else
rejected and returns back to the user choice page.

*Login: In this case, the functionalities channel for him opens(based on his post and department).

6. ADMIN: he can perform various functionalities(use cases) like:
    1. Delete: he can delete a staff member/supervisor. Then it is being removed from Database.
    2. View: Same as above.
    3. Assign: He can assign a particular task to any staff member or supervisor. This will be taken an input string and added     to the database.
    4. Approve/reject: He holds the right to approve/reject any kind of request from supervisor or staff member.


7. SUPERVISOR: he can perform various functionalities(use cases) like:
    1. Add: he can add the staff member. If so, his entry will be added to the database.
    2. Delete: same as above
    3. View: he can choose to view the details/working of his staff member and give his feedback to the staff members.(this          feedback use case will be extended from the View use case since this is completely optional for the supervisor.
    4. Assign: Can assign task to the staff members and the details of the task will be accordingly added to the database of          the staff.
    5. ViewTask: To keep a check on the status of the task.
    6. Logistics: To keep a check on whether everything in his department is going properly or not and in case he feels the          need of any kind of amendment, he requests the admin for the new logistics, this will be an extended use case since it        solely depends on the supervisor whether he wants to make any changes/modifications in the working of the staff.
    7. Leave: can apply for leave to the admin. Same will be updated to the database.
    
8. STAFF: he can perform various functionalities(use cases) like:
    1. Leave: can apply for leave to the admin. Same will be updated to the database.
    2. Logistics: He can request the supervisor for changes in the logistics. This request will be then processed by the              supervisor.
    3. UpdateStatus: He will mention his status as free or busy.
    4. TaskReport: He will send his task report to the supervisor   
 
-->LOGOUT: A use case which will be extended from all the above mentioned use cases as the user can opt to logout from the entire system at any point of time.

-->LOGIN method will contain username and password parameters and the database file will be checked after every successfull login. Else an error message will be shown and user will be asked to login again.
Registration method will contain ID, type, name, username, password, DOB, address, department parameters. Database file will be checked and registration will be successfull if the new user is unique.

-->Task method will contain taskID, Task Name,Task Description Department,Supervisor, Staff, Equipment, status, deadline as parameters. This method will be called when a new task has to be assigned or the status of a task needs to be seen.

-->Leave method will contain Leave to Whom, reason, time period as parameters. This method will be called when either supervisor or staff needs to apply for a leave.

-->Logistic approval request method will have ID, Item with quantities and department as parameters. This method will be called when staff/ supervisor wants to request for material.

-->Logistic requirement request for task method will have ID, items with quantities, task reference ID as parameters. This method will be called when logistics will be required for the execution of a task.

-->Task Report method will contain ID, Task ID, Task Name, Task Description, Items used, Time Taken, Comments as parameters. This method will be called when the task report needs to be generated.

--> We will be using many design patterns in our implementation which will enhance the final output.
